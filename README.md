BSc(Hons) Computer Science Year 2 Semester 2 - Graphical User Interface and Computer Graphics Module

## A. Transformation
Using Java programming, apply the following 2D transformation
on the shapes:
### i) Translation 
### ii) Normal Rotation
### iii) Rotation about a Fixed Point
### iv) Normal Scaling
### v) Scaling about a Fixed Point
### vi) Shear
### vii) Reflections

Bonus: Try implementing an animated Transformation, i.e, animating the transformation
from shape A to T(A) as well as the use composite transformation (for e.g. a Translation
followed by a rotation)

## B. Filling Algorithms
Implement the following filling algorithms on the shape.
### i) Scan line algorithm

## C. Clipping Algorithms
Implement the Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm (Do not use in built function)

## D. GUI
Present all the above functionality on a Graphical User Interface. You are required to
write a report to discuss the design of your GUI and the choice for each GUI element that
you have used.
